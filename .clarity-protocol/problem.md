# Problem Statement

Agents such as openclaw are very powerful and useful, but present severe security hazards: they are very easily compromised in ways that compromise the security of the entire environment in which they operate, and all credentials that they use. Simultaneously, a user often wants to have many agents running at once, doing different things, and it's hard to view and manage all of that.

The goal of Zerg Rush is to create a control panel from which a user can easily and securely manage a fleet of agents, each one of them deployed and managed in a way that its security issues do not spread more widely.
